**Reflections**
1. This Project is good in giving us more insights on the relationships in the OOP concepts. It allows us to test out on the OOP concept in practice. The UML diagram is good in giving me an overall picture of the structure as I am a visual learner.

**My Struggles**
1. I struggled in the part whereby I have to show the score of the enrolled courses.
2. I also could not fully grasped the fundamentals behind OOP concept and manay times I tried and errored.
3. The date validation is also not easy to me, I try to do try catch method. I need to understand the concept more. Exception Handling

**What would make the experience better**
1. Nil as I felt Jean had done her part on giving us the clarification before tests.
2. She also screenshot-ed what are we supposed to see for each option
3. Kudos to Jean for the effort.
